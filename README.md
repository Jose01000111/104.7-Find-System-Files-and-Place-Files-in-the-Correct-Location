# 📁104.7: Find System Files and Place Files in the Correct Location

## ✅ What I Did in This Lab
I used various file location commands to search for binaries, scripts, and configuration files on the system. I explored the structure of the Linux filesystem and confirmed if files are located where they’re supposed to be according to the FHS 📘. I also configured the updatedb service to update the file search index.
